# nesus-
Nessus is a platform developed by Tenable that scans for security vulnerabilities in devices, applications, operating systems, cloud services and other network resources. Originally launched as an open source tool in 1998, its enterprise edition became a commercial product in 2005.

Nessus is now available in two enterprise versions: Nessus Professional and Nessus Expert. Both versions support unlimited IT vulnerability assessments and multiple systems for vulnerability scoring. Nessus Expert also includes capabilities that are not available in Nessus Professional, such as web application scanning, external attack surface scanning and cloud infrastructure scanning.

What is Nessus used for?
The Nessus platform (officially known as Tenable Nessus) is a vulnerability assessment solution that enables organizations to proactively identify and fix security weaknesses or vulnerabilities across their attack surface before cyberattackers have a chance to exploit them. In doing so, they can stay ahead of these adversaries and better protect their business-critical assets from compromise, theft and damage.

Nessus identifies software flaws, missing patches, malware and misconfiguration errors across a wide range of operating systems, devices and applications used in organizations. It also provides configuration, compliance and security audits that enable IT teams to expose previously unknown vulnerabilities that make the business susceptible to cyberattacks and data breaches. Furthermore, Nessus supports multiple vulnerability scoring systems, including CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) v4, EPSS and Tenable's Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) feature, so firms and their security teams can effectively prioritize vulnerability remediation
How does Nessus work?
The Nessus vulnerability scanner scans the IT assets on an organization's attack surface. These scans run regardless of operating systems, devices and applications to identify the vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, software flaws and noncompliant conditions associated with each asset. Nessus compares this information against a database of known issues and generates detailed and configurable reports outlining the discovered vulnerabilities to facilitate remediation.

Nessus includes preconfigured scan templates that enable IT teams to understand where the vulnerabilities exist, which helps them take action to remediate those vulnerabilities. In addition, using out-of-the-box compliance and configuration templates, they can audit the organization's configuration compliance against globally accepted benchmarks and best practices like Center for Internet Security (CIS) and take action to close compliance gaps.

Key features of Nessus
A key feature of Nessus is its vast and growing plugin database. This database is updated with over 100 new plugins that are released weekly within 24 hours of vulnerability disclosure. Also, these plugins update automatically in real time to help IT and security teams speed up assessment, research and remediation of vulnerabilities. They are also dynamically compiled, reducing the database footprint and improving scan performance, efficiency and completion time. These plugins can be customized to create specific checks unique to an organization's application ecosystem and security needs.

Both versions of Nessus include the Predictive Prioritization capability via VPR. VPR -- which is generated by combining Tenable-collected vulnerability data with third-party vulnerability and threat data -- enables IT teams to identify vulnerabilities by their severity. With this information, they can determine which threats pose the greatest risk and highest urgency.

Another key Nessus feature is Live Results, which performs intelligent vulnerability assessment in offline mode so IT teams don't have to run a scan every time a plugin updates. They simply need to log into the platform to get visibility into all potential vulnerabilities based on scan history. And they can also validate vulnerabilities to simplify the process of vulnerability assessments, prioritization and remediation.

Nessus also provides the ability to create configurable reports in a variety of formats, including HTML, comma-separated values and Nessus XML. Reports can be filtered and customized depending on what information is most useful, such as vulnerability types, vulnerabilities by host, vulnerabilities by client, etc.

Another important feature in Nessus is Grouped View. Nessus groups similar issues or categories of vulnerabilities and presents them in one thread, enabling easier vulnerability assessment and prioritization.

The Nessus packet capture feature enables teams to debug and troubleshoot scanning issues, so teams can debug such issues quickly. This minimizes interruptions and provides continuous protection for the enterprise IT environment.

In addition to the above features, Nessus Expert also includes the following:

Support for asset discovery (software, hardware, cloud) in the IT environment.
Audits of operating systems, databases, applications and network infrastructure.
Audits against security framework standards and internal/regulatory requirements.
Active Directory (AD) checks.
Version and change control for servers and endpoints.
Integration-ready scan results -- with third-party IT and security platforms.
